## About this site

This is the source code for the https://www.636mttabor.org/ website. It is a "static site", which means that instead of running constantly as an application on a server somewhere, it is instead a program that is run once to turn this source code into HTML (and CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) and then those resulting files are published. This makes it very fast, very secure, and very, very inexpensive to run.

There are many static site hosting options available, this one uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the hosting and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to transform our source code into the final website.
