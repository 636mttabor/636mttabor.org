The 636th Mt. Tabor BPSA Group is a traditional scouting organization that is open to adults and youth of all genders, and is dedicated to being an open and inclusive outdoor program.

The 636th Mt. Tabor is a registered member of the [Baden-Powell Service Association](http://bpsa-us.org/) (BPSA), which is committed to providing a traditional,  community-oriented scouting experience. **BPSA welcomes all scouts regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion (or no-religion) or other differentiating factors.** Our mission is to provide a positive learning environment within the context of democratic participation and social justice. We foster the development of scouts of all ages in an environment of mutual respect and cooperation.

At its heart, traditional scouting is an outdoor movement and that is a key part of its character. The appeal of true scouting appeals to the vagabond, pioneer and creative explorer within us all, and which is most evident in our youth. BPSA activities focus on these elements, and encourage our scouts, parents, and volunteers to plan programs that take advantage of being outdoors &ndash; whenever and wherever possible!

Yours in traditional scouting,<br/>
&ndash; 636th Mount Tabor Group Scout Masters<br />
