<p><strong>Otter Motto: “Busy and Bright”</strong></p>
<p>Otter is the youngest section of BPSA-US, for scouts age 5-7. Otters learn useful family skills, community skills, and learn to play safely together while being introduced to scouting and preparing for the Timberwolf program.</p>
<p>The Otter section is known as the <em>Raft</em>, has 25-32 scouts, and is led by both a female and male Otter Leader. The Otter <em>Raft</em> is sub-divided into <em>Dens</em> made of 6-8 children. The active participation of adult leaders is needed to ensure we can support and grow the 636th.</p>
<p><strong>Section Schedule Meetings</strong><br />
Otters: Both the Raft and the Den meets once a month, usually two Sundays.</p>
