#### Otter Motto: “Busy and Bright” ####

Otter is the youngest section of BPSA-US, for scouts age 5-7. Otters learn useful family skills, community skills, and learn to play safely together while being introduced to scouting and preparing for the Timberwolf program.

The Otter section is known as the *Raft*, has 25-32 scouts, and is led by both a female and male Otter Leader. The Otter *Raft* is sub-divided into *Dens* made of 6-8 children. The active participation of adult leaders is needed to ensure we can support and grow the 636th.

#### Section Schedule Meetings ####

Otters: Both the Raft and the Den meets once a month, usually two Sundays.
