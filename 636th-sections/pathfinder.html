<p><strong>Pathfinder Motto: “Be Prepared”</strong></p>
<p>The Pathfinder section is open to boys and girls ages 11.5 through 17. The emphasis is on training through hands-on, outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, canoeing and backpacking.</p>
<p>Pathfinder <em>Troops</em> of 25-32 scouts will operate in <em>Patrols</em> of 6 to 8 members, led by a youth Patrol Leader who shares responsibility with an adult leader for discipline, activity planning, and training the less-experienced members. The program is based upon Robert Baden-Powell‘s book, <a href="http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/yarns00-28.pdf" target="_blank">Scouting for Boys</a>.</p>
