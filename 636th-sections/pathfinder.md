#### Pathfinder Motto: “Be Prepared” ####

The Pathfinder section is open to boys and girls ages 11.5 through 17. The emphasis is on training through hands-on, outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, canoeing and backpacking.

Pathfinder *Troops* of 25-32 scouts will operate in *Patrols* of 6 to 8 members, led by a youth Patrol Leader who shares responsibility with an adult leader for discipline, activity planning, and training the less-experienced members. The program is based upon Robert Baden-Powell‘s book, [Scouting for Boys](http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/yarns00-28.pdf).
