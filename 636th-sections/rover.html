<p><strong>Rover Motto: “Service”</strong></p>
<p>Rovers are the senior branch of Baden-Powell Scouting, intended for men and women over the age of 17 who wish to remain uniformed members of a section. As Robert Baden-Powell originally intended, there is no upper age limit. The Rover motto is simply “Service,” and it is put into practice both in the Group and the community.</p>
<p>Rovers are organized into self-governing <em>Crews</em>, and sub-divided into<em> <em>Patrols</em></em>, as part of an overall Scout Group. All BPSA leaders are required to be registered as Rovers to provide them with a more solid background in Scouting.</p>
