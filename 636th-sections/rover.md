#### Rover Motto: “Service” ####

Rovers are the senior branch of Baden-Powell Scouting, intended for men and women over the age of 17 who wish to remain uniformed members of a section. As Robert Baden-Powell originally intended, there is no upper age limit. The Rover motto is simply “Service,” and it is put into practice both in the Group and the community.

Rovers are organized into self-governing *Crews*, and sub-divided into *Patrols*, as part of an overall Scout Group. All BPSA leaders are required to be registered as Rovers to provide them with a more solid background in Scouting.

#### Section Schedule Meetings ####

Rovers: TBD
