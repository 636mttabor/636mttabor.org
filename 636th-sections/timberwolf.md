#### Timberwolf Motto: “Do Your Best” ####

The Timberwolf section is for scouts age 8-11 years of age. This section’s activities are based on The Jungle Book as written by Robert Baden-Powell‘s friend, [Rudyard Kipling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling). The games and practical activities are focused on learning is “by doing.” The overall program is similar in appearance to B-P’s original pre-1960s Wolf Cub program. The focus is on preparing the Timberwolf scout for scouting in the Pathfinder section.

The Timberwolves are in a *Pack* of 25-32 scouts and is led by both a female and male Pack Leader. The Timberwolf Pack is sub-divided into *Sixes* of 5-8 scouts. The active participation of adult leaders is needed to ensure we can support and grow the 636th.

#### Section Schedule Meetings ####

Timberwolves: We generally meet on the first (six) and third (pack) Sundays each month.
