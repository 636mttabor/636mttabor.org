<p><strong>Timberwolf Motto: “Do Your Best”</strong></p>
<p>The Timberwolf section is for scouts age 8-11 years of age. This section’s activities are based on The Jungle Book as written by Robert Baden-Powell‘s friend, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rudyard Kipling</a>. The games and practical activities are focused on learning is “by doing.” The overall program is similar in appearance to B-P’s original pre-1960s Wolf Cub program. The focus is on preparing the Timberwolf scout for scouting in the Pathfinder section.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves are in a <em>Pack</em> of 25-32 scouts and is led by both a female and male Pack Leader. The Timberwolf Pack is sub-divided into <em>Sixes</em> of 5-8 scouts. The active participation of adult leaders is needed to ensure we can support and grow the 636th.</p>
